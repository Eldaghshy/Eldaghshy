- 👋 Hi, I’m @Eldaghshy
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and bioinformatics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R programming and python
- I am currently putting all what I have learned to document my progress and how I evolve in my github to use it as my own reference when I need to.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on bioinformatic projects but when I have better skillset to be capable of doing that.
